# 💪 Training Plan: Optimize Your Fitness Journey

This repository is dedicated to your **Personalized Weight Loss Training Plan**, combining detailed documentation of your exercise regimen with components of a potential web application for tracking.

Our goal is to provide a comprehensive solution to manage and visualize your fitness progress.

## 🎯 Content and Focus

The repository is divided into three main areas to ensure you have access to all the necessary information and tools:

| Area | Description | Reference Files |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Training Plan** | The central document that details the exercise regimen, frequency, and specific guidelines for weight loss. | `Plano de Treino Personalizado para Perda de Peso.md` |
| **Support Resources** | Additional information and articles about exercise and health to complement your plan. | `tuasaude_exercicios.md` |
| **Web Components** | Files suggesting the foundation for a user interface (UI) to view, log, and track your training interactively. | `App.jsx`, `App.css`, `index.html` |
